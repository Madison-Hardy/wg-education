## Agenda 
### Sponsorship Program - Partnership with MOOCs for access to platform and content 
* Connected with Boot Camp [Grand Circus](https://www.grandcircus.co/) to partner with 3-4 boot camps.  They are based out of Detroit, MI.  They have both a full time and part time virtual boot camp, which allows for more people to participate.  They also have job help at the end of boot camp.  They have a 97% completion rate and 90% job placement rate.  They need a criteria for the types of students we would want them to put into a program and how much we would sponsor the students for.  They also would like us to give them information about why a student would choose this career path – C# and .net platforms
* It was suggested to look at boot camps in Asian or Latin American countries – Annesh said he would look into this
* Nicole suggested [ComputerScience.org](https://www.computerscience.org/bootcamps/rankings/net/) as a place to find information.
* We are looking for courses that are good quality, will give them a tangible portfolio and help students find a good job.
* If we have students go through this program, are there mentorship opportunities with .NET?  We would like to get the Maintainers Committee involved.

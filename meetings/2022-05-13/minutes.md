## Agenda ##

* **Website Updates - Proposal for website navigation and included components**
    * Frank Odoom described the ideal updates to the Education pages of the Foundation website, to include an appealing and informative landing page, searchable content, access to training, and links to external sources. Ultimately, the goal is to make educational content accessible to those interested in learning .NET.
    * The committee discussed the design of the pages and expressed that they should be tailored to students, with more engaging and interesting graphics and learning paths that are easy to navigate.
    * To read more about the proposal, or to add suggestions, please see the [Website Proposal Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13XhuGQLeBENff4wPF0vwty0WI3RvzRUMOequAJ4JCY0/edit).

* **Sponsorship Program - Partnership with MOOCs for access to platform and content**
    * Frank introduced the idea to partner with the philanthropic arms of MOOC's to provide training weekends for students and/or unlock .NET educational content.
    * Johan suggested creating a volunteer program within the Foundation to provide support for students. These volunteers would be available throughout the training weekend to answer questions, encourage learning, and increase community involvement.
        * This evolved into a discussion about a Mentorship program (separate from Sponsorship). Mentors would be members of the Foundation community with expertise / interests in specific areas of learning and technologies. They would be listed on the updated website.
            * If this proposal gains traction, there would need to be a way the Mentors could track time spent volunteering with the program, as well as a way to show overall success.
    * The committee discussed how to track the success of the Sponsorship program. Some options include certificates of completion for trainings and tracking career advancement (resume building, creating a LinkedIn profile, scheduling interviews, negotiating and accepting job offers, etc.).
        * Nicole Miller suggested working with the Sponsorship Committee and establishing internships with Foundation sponsors for students who complete the program.

* **Open Discussion: Criteria for education partners and students eligible for sponsorship**
    * The application process: students would apply for scholarships or education programs through the website. Once an application is submitted, the committee would discuss, vet, and approve the candidate during a regularly scheduled meeting.
        * While the Board is aware of this idea, a formal proposal has not yet been submitted for approval. The proposal needs specific qualifiers for both eligible students and collaborative partners. The committee will discuss this in greater detail at a later meeting.

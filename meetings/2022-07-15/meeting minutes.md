[Sponsorship Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_JrNRRc1mhiNLwJr80aBGfjvytj48RCZDQYMeoV0j8/edit)

* Katie and Frank met with Tom following the June Board meeting. The Board is supportive of the Sponsorship initiative, but the budget will need to be adjusted to properly fund the proposal. At a later date, Katie and Frank will meet again with Grand Circus to work on implementation.


### Website ###

[Website Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13XhuGQLeBENff4wPF0vwty0WI3RvzRUMOequAJ4JCY0/edit)

* The current Education page of the DNF site includes a blurb on the working group and mentions the .NET Academy which has been retired. When creating the copy for the new website, the committee wants something more reflective of the current initiatives. The rest of this meeting was a working session for this project - for more information, please see the recording or the website working doc.
    * The Landing Page: Include how .NET works within the education space, what DNF can offer students and educators, and how people can join the committee.
    * The Learning Page: Show students what options are available and where to go to find .NET providers, videos, links to boot camps, or self-guided programs to suit the need of each student.
        * Aneesh suggested organizing the curriculum based on different streams of .NET (web application developing vs cross-platform mobile app developing, as an example). This could point to different resources and group them into specific channels.
    * Student Page: The intention of this page is to define who is a .NET student, outline the sponsorship proposal, include resources for getting jobs, and include free software and other offerings from DNF corporate sponsors.
    * Educators Page: Include copy about why educators teach .NET, provide access to university pages, boot camps, and other resources for teachers.
        * Nicole asked if it was possible to indicate on the Speaker Directory page which speakers are mentors, rather than creating a mentorship page within the Education section. Katie supported the idea, and asked which committee owns the Speaker Directory. Nicole responded that Outreach Cmt owns the directory, and added that as DNF transitions to VMX for the membership portal, there will be an option for members to volunteer as a mentor.


### Action Items ###
* Nicole to add blurb in newsletter asking for help finding growth metrics for DNF
* Katie to contact James Montemagno regarding DNF Discord channel

**The meeting adjourned at 12:53PM ET**

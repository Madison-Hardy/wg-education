## Agenda
 
### General Update
* The [Sponsorship Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_JrNRRc1mhiNLwJr80aBGfjvytj48RCZDQYMeoV0j8/edit) was approved during the July Board meeting, pending proper budgeting. Katie and Frank will continue working with Tom Pappas to move forward.

### Opportunity with [Global Code](https://globalcode.org.uk) in Accra, Ghana
* Global Code is an IT training / bootcamp program targeting university students in West Africa. The initiative is rooted in Python and run by Sam Moorhouse.
* Global Code hosts several opportunities, including monthly sessions. Sam M. is looking for:
    * Volunteers to go to Ghana and assist with the program next July (2023)
        * DNF could likely provide speakers, though it would be difficult getting them to Ghana given costs and time commitments.
    * Input from DNF on software training bootcamps for his agency [turntabl](https://turntabl.io/).
        * turntabl sponsors a Java UserGroup and could be interested in hosting a .NET group if there was a need. If DNF has needs for curriculum or deliverables, the agency could also assist.
        * Frank suggested that turntabl could also assist with in-person events as they start running in the next year. Ideally, DNF and turntabl / Global Code and align and work together.
* Frank and Katie have another meeting with Sam M. scheduled for September 1, 2022, and asked the committee to send any discussion topics if applicable.

### Future Initiatives - Working Session
* Mentorships
    * Who (Target Audience)
        * Students with some programming experience
        * Focused on C#/F#/.NET
        * Junior developers, those entering or looking for their first job
        * Those in or applied to the Sponsorship program with Grand Circus
        * Disadvantaged, underserved communities
    * Resources
        * DNF members, general .NET community
        * Speaker Directory
        * Workshops-in-a-box
    * What we can do:
        * Presence at events
            * Provide - hardware (iot); Katie to ask about budget allowance
            * Establish a presence at existing events
            * Swag for events
                * Nicole to ship to Ghana
                * Katie to send .NET MAUI sticker design
        * Promoting, hosting, connecting mentors
            * Place to connect mentors and mentees
                * Discord
                    * Katie and Nicole discussed the benefits of a specific mentor/mentee channel versus an open forum and how to create the channel on Discord. They will continue working to create this and establish guidance for how to utilize.
                * Speaker List
                    * Adding a "Mentor" tag for any DNF speaker who chooses to act as a mentor. This would be visible on their individual speaker page. 
                    * Adding a "Book me on Calendly" option, also visible on their individual speaker page.
                    * Nicole to find the form on GitHub to update the tags. She mentioned that this topic will need to be revisited as the membership portal goes live as there should be a feature available to identify mentors.
                * Specific Meetup groups
                * Within DNF
            * Mentor "Booking" on the DNF Website
                * Frank suggested that if mentors can show availability within a given week, people can book time as needed.
                * Nicole noted that this may be difficult to manage as popular or well-known developers may be sought after more than others, which could be a deterrent.
                * Katie asked about the DNF Website update and whether this can be an included feature. Nicole stated that a specific timeline has not been publicized yet, but she expects it to be about six weeks before the new site is live. Isaac L., Marketing Chair, would know more specifics.

* Startups
    * Frank introduced the idea of targeting (startup) project founders as a way to introduce Open Source technology to a new community of developers. As many founders just aren't aware of what .NET can offer, focusing on startups allows founders the opportunity to look at the .NET ecosystem to see how they can build their next project, or how to progress their current project. He added that startups could need support from two angles: 1) Tech Experience - how to build e-commerce products, how to properly scale, and how to build and secure products; and 2) Marketing Experience - how to scale out of MVP, how to target the market and which market to target.
    * Who (Target Audience)
        * Students, junior developers, those interested in entrepreneurship
    * What
        * Education for *Building*
            * [Workshops](https://dotnetfoundation.org/community/resources)

            * Expertise, guidance for their specific project
            * Connect founders with experts within DNF
                * Technical / Maintainers, Promotions / Marketing
                * The committee could partner with other DNF committees to establish "Support Teams" or focused task forces as this coincides with an ongoing DNF initiative to support maintainers.
    * Where and How
        * Hubs, incubators, bootcamps (where students go to learn)
        * Frank mentioned he has a contact with an incubator that could assist with this process.

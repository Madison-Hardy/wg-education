Browse the [meeting archive](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-education/tree/master/meetings) or the [Issues tab](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-education/issues) if you'd like to get familiar with what we're currently working on and how you can help out.

## Current Initiatives

### .NET Training for CS Students
Develop and run a program for students to learn about full stack web development using C# and .NET Core. The curriculum is a 12-week classroom-based course that combines hands-on lectures and workshops. Students will develop a project from design to deployment while applying the tools, concepts, and processes desired by high-tech employers. 

## Proposals
If you have an idea you would like to propose to the Education committee relating to the main goals of our group, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/wg-education/issues) in our working group GitHub repository. We are still working on a more formal proposal process.

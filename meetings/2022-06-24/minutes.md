### Sponsorship Program - Updates from the Board ###

[Sponsorship Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j_JrNRRc1mhiNLwJr80aBGfjvytj48RCZDQYMeoV0j8/edit)

* The committee has drafted a second version (V2) of the education proposal and discussed the changes. The proposal partners with [Grand Circus](https://www.grandcircus.co/) and details a budget request of $50,000 to sponsor 10 students, the criteria selection to vet the students participating, and how to promote the program. The proposal also outlines the potential for the pilot to expand if successful and has clear quantitative and qualitative measures of success.
* At the DNF Board meeting (June 23rd), the proposal was presented and briefly discussed. Katie and Frank will meet with Tom Pappas (DNF Executive Director) in the coming weeks to finalize the proposal and next steps.
    * Mike W referenced the [2022 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-learning-to-code-learning-how-to-code) which revealed that 70% of developers learn to code online and only 10% utilize a bootcamp. He asked if partnering with a bootcamp at this time is the most effective way to promote the committee's long-term goal of facilitating the adoption of .NET globally. Katie responded that while the sponsorship proposal has been at the forefront of the committee's agenda, the Foundation is still working to update the DNF website which provides the Education Committee the opportunity to recommend free and accessible content. The sponsorship program acts as a way to directly impact students with limited exposure and resources; while it has a smaller scope, it has a larger impact to those participating.
    * Aneesh added that the sponsorship program can act as an excellent marketing opportunity and as a way to connect with corporate sponsors. The tangible and quantifiable impact on students shows a more personal touch, and graduates of the program may become positive advocates for both the Foundation and .NET as a whole.


## Next Steps / Action Items ##
* Katie S and Frank O to meet with Tom P to discuss next steps for the sponsorship proposal.

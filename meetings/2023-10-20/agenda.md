Hi Everyone! At this week's Education Committee meeting, we'll have Tori Brenneison (tori.brenneison@gmail.com) with Tech Elevator joining us. This aligns with our current initiative to support C#/.NET educators! Come with any questions you have about how Tori and Tech Elevator are teaching .NET, how they develop curriculum, what support we can provide, etc.

Thank you!
Katie

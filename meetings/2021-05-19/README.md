The Committee aims to launch in Fall 2021. The program will target students who are already enrolled in higher education computer science courses. The Bootcamp will be taught online once a week. Each lecture/workshop class will last 2.5 hours. The future goal would be to provide the Bootcamp’s course materials to other colleges around the world. The Education Committee held a discussion around the course outline.
